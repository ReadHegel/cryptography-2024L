\section{Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Bilinear Pairings (part 1)}

[Feb 24]

\paragraph{Content:} We gave a general introduction to the elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear pairings. We defined elliptic curves and their group law, and we discussed the discrete logarithm problem in the context of elliptic curves. We also introduced the notion of bilinear pairings and discussed their applications in cryptography. We then presented the construction of the BLS signature scheme \cite{Boneh2001} (the proof was given in the exercise class after the lecture). 

\paragraph{Material:} We mostly followed this book \cite{Boneh2023} (pages 615--618, second half of page 619, Section 15.4 until the middle of page 628). Another good reference are the online lectures \cite{WinterSchool} (lectures ``School overview'' and ``The Basics of Pairings'').
