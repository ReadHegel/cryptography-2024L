\section{Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Bilinear Pairings (part 1)}

[Feb 24]

\paragraph{Content:} We gave a general introduction to the elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear pairings. We defined elliptic curves and their group law, and we discussed the discrete logarithm problem in the context of elliptic curves. We also introduced the notion of bilinear pairings and discussed their applications in cryptography. We then presented the construction of the BLS signature scheme \cite{Boneh2001} (the proof was given in the exercise class after the lecture). 

\paragraph{Material:} We mostly followed this book \cite{Boneh2023}. Another good reference are the online lectures
